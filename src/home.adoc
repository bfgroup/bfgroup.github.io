We are a group of developers writing software solutions to solve common
software building problems. Our goal is to provide a highliy reused set
of components that advances software buiding technology.

== Projects

=== `std_cpp`

This is library proposes to standardize the build interface for compiling
C++ source. This is both a specification and an impementation proof. As
such it provides both a library that can be used to build upon and a
minimal `std_cpp` tool for some common C++ compilers.
